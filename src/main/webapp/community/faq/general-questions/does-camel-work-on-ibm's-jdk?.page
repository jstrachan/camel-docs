h2. Does Camel work on IBM's JDK?
Yes, we've tested Camel with IBM's JDK on the AIX and Linux platforms. There are a few things to look out for though

h3. Exception using camel-http

You may get a sun.io.MalformedInputException when using camel-http on IBM's JDK. [http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/linux/142/runtimeguide.lnx.en.html] lists a possible solution: if LANG=en_US.UTF-8, just set it to LANG=en_US.

h3. Building camel-spring component

The schema generation portion of camel-spring uses Sun specific tools and thus cannot run on IBM's JDK. It will currently try to download an XSD generated from a previous build and then run the tests against that. So, if you need to change Camel's model, you will need to rebuild camel-spring on another JDK (preferably a Sun JDK).  

h3. Ruby scripting support

Ruby scripting on IBM's JDK works for Camel 2.0 and onward. For earlier versions you'll need to use one of the other [Scripting Languages]. See [CAMEL-1030|https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/CAMEL-1030] for more details.
