h2. How do I change the logging

We use [commons-logging|http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/logging/] to log information in the broker client and the broker itself so you can fully configure the logging levels desired, whether to log to files or the console, as well as the underlying logging implementation (Log4J, Java SE logger, etc.) you wish to use. For Log4J, full instructions are in its [manual|http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs/manual.html], but in a nutshell:

*  Add log4j.jar to your classpath
*  Create a log4j.properties file specifying desired logging configuration (The Camel distribution has example log4j.properties files you can use -- see for example in the \examples\camel-example-bam\src\main\resources folder.)
*  Place the log4j.properties file in the folder where the compiled .class files are located (typically the "classes" folder)--this will place the properties file on the classpath, where it needs to be at runtime.
