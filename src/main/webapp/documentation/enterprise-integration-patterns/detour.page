h3. Detour
The [Detour|http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/Detour.html] from the [EIP patterns|Enterprise Integration Patterns] allows you to send messages through additional steps if a control condition is met. It can be useful for turning on extra validation, testing, debugging code when needed.

Available in Camel 1.5.

h4. Example

In this example we essentially have a route like {{from("direct:start").to("mock:result")}} with a conditional detour to the {{mock:detour}} endpoint in the middle of the route..

{snippet:id=e1|lang=java|url=camel/trunk/camel-core/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/processor/DetourTest.java}

whether the detour is turned on or off is decided by the {{ControlBean}}. So, when the detour is on the message is routed to {{mock:detour}} and then {{mock:result}}. When the detour is off, the message is routed to {{mock:result}}.
