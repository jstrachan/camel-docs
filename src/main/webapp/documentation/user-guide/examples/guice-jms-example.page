h2. Guice JMS Example (from 1.5 onwards)

The Guice JMS example is functionally similar to both the [first example|Walk through an Example] and the [Spring Example] but using [Guice] as the Dependency Injection framework.

In this example we just write RouteBuilder implementations, then we write a Guice module [MyModule|http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/camel/trunk/examples/camel-example-guice-jms/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/example/guice/jms/MyModule.java] to create the CamelContext, bind any RouteBuilder instances and configure any components and endpoints, then we create a [jndi.properties|http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/camel/trunk/examples/camel-example-guice-jms/src/main/resources/jndi.properties] file to bootstrap Guice and Camel.

To run the example we currently use the maven exec plugin. For example from the source or binary distribution the following should work

{code}
cd examples/camel-example-guice-jms
mvn compile exec:java
{code}

What this does is boot up the Guice based JNDI provider from [jndi.properties|http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/camel/trunk/examples/camel-example-guice-jms/src/main/resources/jndi.properties] file on the classpath. This then bootstraps the Guice injector and loads whatever Guice modules are defined in the jndi.properties file - then injects the remaining properties in the file.

h3. Configuring Components

If you see the *jms()* method of the Guice [MyModule|http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/camel/trunk/examples/camel-example-guice-jms/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/example/guice/jms/MyModule.java] you will see it is annotated with *@Provides* to indicate to Guice that it is a provider and it is annotated with *@JndiBind("jms")* to bind it to the JNDI name *jms* when it is created. 

This method then configures the component. The provider method is parameterized by the *@Named("activemq.brokerURL")* property which is injected from the [jndi.properties|http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/camel/trunk/examples/camel-example-guice-jms/src/main/resources/jndi.properties] file. This lets you define the properties which should be environment specific (such as URLs, machine names, usernames/passwords and so forth) while leaving all of the other configuration which does not change in different environments in Java code.

So you can use [Guice] to dependency inject whatever objects you need to create, be it an [Endpoint], [Component], [RouteBuilder] or arbitrary [bean used within a route|Bean Integration]. Then you can inject any properties from the jndi.properties file easily - so that most of your configuration is all in Java code which is typesafe and easily refactorable - then leaving some properties to be environment specific (the jndi.properties file) which you can then change based on development, testing, production etc.
