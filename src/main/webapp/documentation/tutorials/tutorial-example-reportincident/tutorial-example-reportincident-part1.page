h2. Part 1

h2. Prerequisites
This tutorial uses the following frameworks:
* Maven 2.0.9
* Apache Camel 1.4.0
* Apache CXF 2.1.1
* Spring 2.5.5

*Note:* The sample project can be downloaded, see the [resources|#Resources] section.

h2. Initial Project Setup
We want the integration to be a standard .war application that can be deployed in any web container such as Tomcat, Jetty or even heavy weight application servers such as WebLogic or WebSphere. There fore we start off with the standard Maven webapp project that is created with the following long archetype command:

{code}
mvn archetype:create -DgroupId=org.apache.camel -DartifactId=camel-example-reportincident -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-webapp
{code}

Notice that the groupId etc. doens't have to be org.apache.camel it can be com.mycompany.whatever. But I have used these package names as the example is an official part of the Camel distribution.

Then we have the basic maven folder layout. We start out with the webservice part where we want to use Apache CXF for the webservice stuff. So we add this to the pom.xml
{code:xml}
    <properties>
        <cxf-version>2.1.1</cxf-version>
    </properties>

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.cxf</groupId>
        <artifactId>cxf-rt-core</artifactId>
        <version>${cxf-version}</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.cxf</groupId>
        <artifactId>cxf-rt-frontend-jaxws</artifactId>
        <version>${cxf-version}</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.cxf</groupId>
        <artifactId>cxf-rt-transports-http</artifactId>
        <version>${cxf-version}</version>
    </dependency>
{code}

h2. Developing the WebService
As we want to develop webservice with the contract first approach we create our .wsdl file. As this is a example we have simplified the model of the incident to only include 8 fields. In real life the model would be a bit more complex, but not to much.

We put the wsdl file in the folder {{src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/wsdl}} and name the file {{report_incident.wsdl}}.

{code:xml}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<wsdl:definitions xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/soap/"
	xmlns:tns="http://reportincident.example.camel.apache.org"

	</wsdl:portType>

	<!-- Port bindings to transports and encoding - HTTP, document literal encoding is used -->

				<soap:body parts="parameters" use="literal"/>
			</wsdl:input>
			<wsdl:output>

			</wsdl:output>
		</wsdl:operation>
	</wsdl:binding>

	<!-- Service definition -->
	<wsdl:service name="ReportIncidentService">
		<wsdl:port name="ReportIncidentPort" binding="tns:ReportIncidentBinding">
			<soap:address location="http://reportincident.example.camel.apache.org"/>
		</wsdl:port>
	</wsdl:service>

</wsdl:definitions>
{code}
h3. CXF wsdl2java
Then we integration the CXF wsdl2java generator in the pom.xml so we have CXF generate the needed POJO classes for our webservice contract. 
However at first we must configure maven to live in the modern world of Java 1.5 so we must add this to the pom.xml
{code:xml}
			<!-- to compile with 1.5 -->
			<plugin>
				<groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
				<artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
				<configuration>
					<source>1.5</source>
					<target>1.5</target>
				</configuration>
			</plugin>
{code}

And then we can add the CXF wsdl2java code generator that will hook into the compile goal so its automatic run all the time:
{code:xml}
			<!-- CXF wsdl2java generator, will plugin to the compile goal -->
			<plugin>
				<groupId>org.apache.cxf</groupId>
				<artifactId>cxf-codegen-plugin</artifactId>
				<version>${cxf-version}</version>
				<executions>
					<execution>
						<id>generate-sources</id>
						<phase>generate-sources</phase>
						<configuration>
							<sourceRoot>${basedir}/target/generated/src/main/java</sourceRoot>
							<wsdlOptions>
								<wsdlOption>
									<wsdl>${basedir}/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/wsdl/report_incident.wsdl</wsdl>
								</wsdlOption>
							</wsdlOptions>
						</configuration>
						<goals>
							<goal>wsdl2java</goal>
						</goals>
					</execution>
				</executions>
			</plugin>
{code}

You are now setup and should be able to compile the project. So running the {{mvn compile}} should run the CXF wsdl2java and generate the source code in the folder {{&amp;\{basedir\}/target/generated/src/main/java}} that we specified in the pom.xml above. Since its in the {{target/generated/src/main/java}} maven will pick it up and include it in the build process. 

h3. Configuration of the web.xml
Next up is to configure the web.xml to be ready to use CXF so we can expose the webservice.
As Spring is the center of the universe, or at least is a very important framework in today's Java land we start with the listener that kick-starts Spring. This is the usual piece of code:
{code:xml}
	<!-- the listener that kick-starts Spring -->
	<listener>
		<listener-class>org.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListener</listener-class>
	</listener>
{code}
And then we have the CXF part where we define the CXF servlet and its URI mappings to which we have chosen that all our webservices should be in the path {{/webservices/}}
{code:xml}
	<!-- CXF servlet -->
	<servlet>
		<servlet-name>CXFServlet</servlet-name>
		<servlet-class>org.apache.cxf.transport.servlet.CXFServlet</servlet-class>
		<load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>
	</servlet>

	<!-- all our webservices are mapped under this URI pattern -->
	<servlet-mapping>
		<servlet-name>CXFServlet</servlet-name>
		<url-pattern>/webservices/*</url-pattern>
	</servlet-mapping>
{code}

Then the last piece of the puzzle is to configure CXF, this is done in a spring XML that we link to fron the web.xml by the standard Spring {{contextConfigLocation}} property in the web.xml
{code:xml}
	<!-- location of spring xml files -->
	<context-param>
		<param-name>contextConfigLocation</param-name>
		<param-value>classpath:cxf-config.xml</param-value>
	</context-param>
{code}
We have named our CXF configuration file {{cxf-config.xml}} and its located in the root of the classpath. In Maven land that is we can have the {{cxf-config.xml}} file in the {{src/main/resources}} folder. We could also have the file located in the WEB-INF folder for instance {{<param-value>/WEB-INF/cxf-config.xml</param-value>}}.

h3. Getting rid of the old jsp world
The maven archetype that created the basic folder structure also created a sample .jsp file index.jsp. This file {{src/main/webapp/index.jsp}} should be deleted. 

h3. Configuration of CXF
The cxf-config.xml is as follows:
{code:xml}
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xmlns:jaxws="http://cxf.apache.org/jaxws"
       xsi:schemaLocation="
            http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-2.0.xsd
            http://cxf.apache.org/jaxws http://cxf.apache.org/schemas/jaxws.xsd">

    <import resource="classpath:META-INF/cxf/cxf.xml"/>
    <import resource="classpath:META-INF/cxf/cxf-extension-soap.xml"/>
    <import resource="classpath:META-INF/cxf/cxf-servlet.xml"/>

    <!-- implementation of the webservice -->
    <bean id="reportIncidentEndpoint" class="org.apache.camel.example.reportincident.ReportIncidentEndpointImpl"/>

    <!-- export the webservice using jaxws -->
    <jaxws:endpoint id="reportIncident"
                    implementor="#reportIncidentEndpoint"
                    address="/incident"
                    wsdlLocation="/WEB-INF/wsdl/report_incident.wsdl"
                    endpointName="s:ReportIncidentPort"
                    serviceName="s:ReportIncidentService"
                    xmlns:s="http://reportincident.example.camel.apache.org"/>

</beans>
{code}

The configuration is standard [CXF] and is documented at the [Apache CXF website|http://cxf.apache.org/].

The 3 import elements is needed by CXF and they must be in the file.

Noticed that we have a spring bean *reportIncidentEndpoint* that is the implementation of the webservice endpoint we let CXF expose.
Its linked from the jaxws element with the implementator attribute as we use the # mark to identify its a reference to a spring bean. We could have stated the classname directly as {{implementor="org.apache.camel.example.reportincident.ReportIncidentEndpoint"}} but then we lose the ability to let the ReportIncidentEndpoint be configured by spring.
The *address* attribute defines the relative part of the URL of the exposed webservice. *wsdlLocation* is an optional parameter but for persons like me that likes contract-first we want to expose our own .wsdl contracts and not the auto generated by the frameworks, so with this attribute we can link to the real .wsdl file. The last stuff is needed by CXF as you could have several services so it needs to know which this one is. Configuring these is quite easy as all the information is in the wsdl already.

h3. Implementing the ReportIncidentEndpoint
Phew after all these meta files its time for some java code so we should code the implementor of the webservice. So we fire up {{mvn compile}} to let CXF generate the POJO classes for our webservice and we are ready to fire up a Java editor.

You can use {{mvn idea:idea}} or {{mvn eclipse:eclipse}} to create project files for these editors so you can load the project. However IDEA has been smarter lately and can load a pom.xml directly.

As we want to quickly see our webservice we implement just a quick and dirty as it can get. At first beware that since its jaxws and Java 1.5 we get annotations for the money, but they reside on the interface so we can remove them from our implementations so its a nice plain POJO again:
{code:java}
package org.apache.camel.example.reportincident;

/**
 * The webservice we have implemented.
 */
public class ReportIncidentEndpointImpl implements ReportIncidentEndpoint {

    public OutputReportIncident reportIncident(InputReportIncident parameters) {
        System.out.println("Hello ReportIncidentEndpointImpl is called from " + parameters.getGivenName());

        OutputReportIncident out = new OutputReportIncident();
        out.setCode("OK");
        return out;
    }

}
{code}

We just output the person that invokes this webservice and returns a OK response. This class should be in the maven source root folder {{src/main/java}} under the package name {{org.apache.camel.example.reportincident}}. Beware that the maven archetype tool didn't create the {{src/main/java folder}}, so you should create it manually.

To test if we are home free we run {{mvn clean compile}}.

h3. Running our webservice
Now that the code compiles we would like to run it in a web container, so we add jetty to our pom.xml so we can run {{mvn jetty:run}}:
{code:xml}
	<properties>
             ...
             <jetty-version>6.1.1</jetty-version>
	</properties>

       <build>
           <plugins>
               ...
               <!-- so we can run mvn jetty:run -->
               <plugin>
                   <groupId>org.mortbay.jetty</groupId>
                   <artifactId>maven-jetty-plugin</artifactId>
                   <version>${jetty-version}</version>
               </plugin>
{code}
*Notice:* We use Jetty v6.1.1 as never versions has troubles on my laptop. Feel free to try a newer version on your system, but v6.1.1 works flawless.

So to see if everything is in order we fire up jetty with {{mvn jetty:run}} and if everything is okay you should be able to access {{http://localhost:8080}}.
Jetty is smart that it will list the correct URI on the page to our web application, so just click on the link. This is smart as you don't have to remember the exact web context URI for your application - just fire up the default page and Jetty will help you.

So where is the damn webservice then? Well as we did configure the web.xml to instruct the CXF servlet to accept the pattern {{/webservices/*}} we should hit this URL to get the attention of CXF: {{http://localhost:8080/camel-example-reportincident/webservices}}.
!tutorial_reportincident_cxf_servicelist2.png!
&nbsp;

h3. Hitting the webservice
Now we have the webservice running in a standard .war application in a standard web container such as Jetty we would like to invoke the webservice and see if we get our code executed. Unfortunately this isn't the easiest task in the world - its not so easy as a REST URL, so we need tools for this. So we fire up our trusty webservice tool [SoapUI|http://www.soapui.org/] and let it be the one to fire the webservice request and see the response.

Using SoapUI we sent a request to our webservice and we got the expected OK response and the console outputs the System.out so we are ready to code.
!tutorial_reportincident_soapui2.png!
&nbsp;

h3. Remote Debugging
Okay a little sidestep but wouldn't it be cool to be able to debug your code when its fired up under Jetty? As Jetty is started from maven, we need to instruct maven to use debug mode. 
Se we set the {{MAVEN_OPTS}} environment to start in debug mode and listen on port 5005.
{code}
MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=128m -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=5005
{code}

Then you need to restart Jetty so its stopped with *ctrl + c*. Remember to start a new shell to pickup the new environment settings. And start jetty again.

Then we can from our IDE attach a remote debugger and debug as we want.
First we configure IDEA to attach to a remote debugger on port 5005:
!tutorial_reportincident_remotedebug_idea_setup2.png!
&nbsp;

Then we set a breakpoint in our code {{ReportIncidentEndpoint}} and hit the SoapUI once again and we are breaked at the breakpoint where we can inspect the parameters:
!tutorial_reportincident_remotedebug_idea_breakpoint2.png!
&nbsp;

h3. Adding a unit test
Oh so much hard work just to hit a webservice, why can't we just use an unit test to invoke our webservice? Yes of course we can do this, and that's the next step.
First we create the folder structure {{src/test/java}} and {{src/test/resources}}. We then create the unit test in the {{src/test/java}} folder.
{code:java}
package org.apache.camel.example.reportincident;

import junit.framework.TestCase;

/**
 * Plain JUnit test of our webservice.
 */
public class ReportIncidentEndpointTest extends TestCase {

}
{code}
Here we have a plain old JUnit class. As we want to test webservices we need to start and expose our webservice in the unit test before we can test it. And JAXWS has pretty decent methods to help us here, the code is simple as:
{code:java}
    import javax.xml.ws.Endpoint;
    ...

    private static String ADDRESS = "http://localhost:9090/unittest";

    protected void startServer() throws Exception {
        // We need to start a server that exposes or webservice during the unit testing
        // We use jaxws to do this pretty simple
        ReportIncidentEndpointImpl server = new ReportIncidentEndpointImpl();
        Endpoint.publish(ADDRESS, server);
    }
{code}

The Endpoint class is the {{javax.xml.ws.Endpoint}} that under the covers looks for a provider and in our case its CXF - so its CXF that does the heavy lifting of exposing out webservice on the given URL address. Since our class ReportIncidentEndpointImpl implements the interface *ReportIncidentEndpoint* that is decorated with all the jaxws annotations it got all the information it need to expose the webservice. Below is the CXF wsdl2java generated interface:
{code:java}

/*
 * 
 */

package org.apache.camel.example.reportincident;

import javax.jws.WebMethod;
import javax.jws.WebParam;
import javax.jws.WebResult;
import javax.jws.WebService;
import javax.jws.soap.SOAPBinding;
import javax.jws.soap.SOAPBinding.ParameterStyle;
import javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlSeeAlso;

/**
 * This class was generated by Apache CXF 2.1.1
 * Wed Jul 16 12:40:31 CEST 2008
 * Generated source version: 2.1.1
 * 
 */
 
 /*
  * 
  */


@WebService(targetNamespace = "http://reportincident.example.camel.apache.org", name = "ReportIncidentEndpoint")
@XmlSeeAlso({ObjectFactory.class})
@SOAPBinding(parameterStyle = SOAPBinding.ParameterStyle.BARE)

public interface ReportIncidentEndpoint {

/*
 * 
 */

    @SOAPBinding(parameterStyle = SOAPBinding.ParameterStyle.BARE)
    @WebResult(name = "outputReportIncident", targetNamespace = "http://reportincident.example.camel.apache.org", partName = "parameters")
    @WebMethod(operationName = "ReportIncident", action = "http://reportincident.example.camel.apache.org/ReportIncident")
    public OutputReportIncident reportIncident(
        @WebParam(partName = "parameters", name = "inputReportIncident", targetNamespace = "http://reportincident.example.camel.apache.org")
        InputReportIncident parameters
    );
}
{code}
 
Next up is to create a webservice client so we can invoke our webservice. For this we actually use the CXF framework directly as its a bit more easier to create a client using this framework than using the JAXWS style. We could have done the same for the server part, and you should do this if you need more power and access more advanced features.

{code:java}
    import org.apache.cxf.jaxws.JaxWsProxyFactoryBean;
    ...
    
    protected ReportIncidentEndpoint createCXFClient() {
        // we use CXF to create a client for us as its easier than JAXWS and works
        JaxWsProxyFactoryBean factory = new JaxWsProxyFactoryBean();
        factory.setServiceClass(ReportIncidentEndpoint.class);
        factory.setAddress(ADDRESS);
        return (ReportIncidentEndpoint) factory.create();
    }
{code}

So now we are ready for creating a unit test. We have the server and the client. So we just create a plain simple unit test method as the usual junit style:
{code:java}
    public void testRendportIncident() throws Exception {
        startServer();

        ReportIncidentEndpoint client = createCXFClient();

        InputReportIncident input = new InputReportIncident();
        input.setIncidentId("123");
        input.setIncidentDate("2008-07-16");
        input.setGivenName("Claus");
        input.setFamilyName("Ibsen");
        input.setSummary("bla bla");
        input.setDetails("more bla bla");
        input.setEmail("davsclaus@apache.org");
        input.setPhone("+45 2962 7576");

        OutputReportIncident out = client.reportIncident(input);
        assertEquals("Response code is wrong", "OK", out.getCode());
    }
{code}

Now we are nearly there. But if you run the unit test with {{mvn test}} then it will fail. Why!!! Well its because that CXF needs is missing some dependencies during unit testing. In fact it needs the web container, so we need to add this to our *pom.xml*.
{code:xml}
    <!-- cxf web container for unit testing -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.cxf</groupId>
        <artifactId>cxf-rt-transports-http-jetty</artifactId>
        <version>${cxf-version}</version>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
{code}

Well what is that, CXF also uses Jetty for unit test - well its just shows how agile, embedable and popular Jetty is.

So lets run our junit test with, and it reports:
{code}
mvn test
Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESSFUL
{code}

Yep thats it for now. We have a basic project setup.


h2. End of part 1
Thanks for being patient and reading all this more or less standard Maven, Spring, JAXWS and Apache CXF stuff. Its stuff that is well covered on the net, but I wanted a full fledged tutorial on a maven project setup that is web service ready with Apache CXF. We will use this as a base for the next part where we demonstrate how Camel can be digested slowly and piece by piece just as it was back in the times when was introduced and was learning the Spring framework that we take for granted today.
