h2. Camel 2.3 - Overhaul of Aggregator EIP

The [Aggregator] EIP needs an overhaul in Camel to remedy a few new features, improvements and fix an issue with using completion predicate and timeout.

h3. Current issues
- Build on top of BatchProcessor which has to complex logic for concurrent locking and accepting new messages.
- BatchProcessor was originally designed to help with batch and transactions
- Either BatchProcessor needs to be reworked or a new base class implemented
- Completion predicate and batch timeout does not work together
- Batch timeout is actually a interval check timeout
- AggregationStrategy is invoked to _late_ as its only invoked when the batch timeout triggers
- BatchSender is single threaded

h3. New Design
- BatchSender should use ExecutorsService that ensures if a thread is dead a new thread will be started, eg the task is always running. *DONE*
- BatchSender is currently only a single thread. We should support concurrency, so you can have multiple output based on per correlation key. *DONE*
- BatchSender should have simpler logic for enqueing and locking if possible. *DONE*
- BatchProcessor should support persistent, so aggregated exchanges can be stored in a database using [JPA]. See how we do this with the [Idempotent Consumer] and/or [Tracer]. *DONE*
- If possible: AggregationStrategy should be invoked on the fly so you in the future can use it to determine if we are complete. *DONE*
- Batch timeout and completion predicate should work together so the completion is triggered by the first one. *DONE*
- Batch timeout should be per correlation key based, and not a single global timeout. *DONE*
- Add POJO based aggregation strategy so you can avoid using the low level Exchange APIs
- Add option what to do in case the correlation key cannot be evaluated, eg to ignore or throw an exception back to caller. *DONE*
- Add option to ignore to _late_ exchanges if a correlation key has been _closed_. *DONE*
- Look all JIRA tickets at Apache what we have for the [Aggregator] *DONE*
- [Resequencer] is also using the {{BatchProcessor}} so we should ensure it works as well and maybe it can benefit some of the new features as well.
- Add persistent AggregationRepository out of the box *DONE*
- Configuration of completion options should be more dynamic such as timeout and size *DONE*
